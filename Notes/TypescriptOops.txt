/** Here we will Try to Learn the Oops Concept in Typescript */

/** (@_@) ---- Oop Concepts (Object Oriented Programming Concepts) ---- (@_@) **/

1. Classes :
-----------------
    - Classes are nothing but the blueprint of Object which is used to define n number of object of same type.
    - TypeScript introduced classes to avail the benefit of object-oriented techniques like encapsulation and abstraction. 
    - The class in TypeScript is compiled to plain JavaScript functions by the TypeScript compiler to work across platforms and browsers.
    - A class can include the following: (To See Exact Example Please look into OopsTypescriptConcept Project)
        - Properties : 
      >-------------------<
            - this are the Properties or we can say variable of a class.
            - we also have the feature to assign the default values to the properties of a class.
        - Methods : 
      >-------------------<
            - this are the function or we can say Prototypes of class which provide the services on behalf of class.
            - such as getter & Setter Methods which provide the service of getting or setting the properties values of class.
            - for example : getName() {
                                return this.name;
                            }
        - Constructor : 
      >--------------------<
            - this are Special Method Used to Construct the Object of Classes.
            - we have atmost single Constructor be defined in a particular class.
            - construct can be defined using `constructor` keyword.
            - for ex: constructor(id: string, name: string) {
                        this.id = id;
                        this.name = name;
                      }
            - constructor can also be used to perform shorthand code to define the class properties.
              By Shorthand we simply means class without define properties explicitly.
            - for ex : class Employee {
                        constructor(id: string, name: string) {};
                       }

        - getter & setter : 
      >--------------------<
            - this are Special Method Used to get & set the Properties value of class.
            - Getter can be defined by using `get` keyword while setter define usin `set` keyword.
            - Please note They are use same as that we use normal properties without circular brackets "()".
            - for ex: 
                 <******----Setter Example----****>
                    set setId (id: string) {
                        this.id = id;
                    }
                 <******----Getter Example----****>
                    get getId () {
                        return this.id;
                    }

2. Access Modifiers :
-------------------------
    - Access Modifiers are one of the most import Concept introduced in the Typescript.
    - Access Modifiers are used mostly to restrict the access of properties of the class to be modified directly.
    - There are three types of access introduced by the Typescript, which are :
        - public :
      >----------------<
            - it is the default access of every property defined without access modifier inside a class.
            - it simply means that the property can be publically available and can be modified by any outside function.
            - it is defined by using `public` keyword.
        - private :
      >----------------<
            - it is one of the other important access modifier to restrict direct access to property.
            - it simply means that the property can't be modified by any outside function.
            - it is defined by using `private` keyword.
        - protected :
      >----------------<
            - it is one of the other important access modifier to restrict direct access to property.
            - it simply means that the property can't be modified by any outside function but can be modified by inherited classes.
            - it is defined by using `protected` keyword.
        - readonly :
      >----------------<
            - it is one of the another access modifier which is also used along with other access modifier.
            - it simply means that once the property is intilize with any value then after it can't be modified but read.
            - it is defined by using `readonly` keyword.
            '
    - for example : class demo {
                        private readonly id: string;
                        private name: string;
                        public isDemoClass: boolean;
                        protected employeeList: string[];
                    }

3. Static Methods & Properties :
---------------------------------------
    - Static Methods and Properties are one of the most important concept for any class.
    - The Static members (properties and methods) of a class are accessed using the class name and dot notation, without creating an object 
    - For Example : <ClassName>.<StaticMember>
    - The static members can be defined by using the keyword `static`.
    - for example : class Circle {
                        static pi: number = 3.14;               // static property
                        static calculateArea(radius:number) {   // static method
                            return this.pi * radius * radius;
                        }
                    }
                    Circle.pi;                                 // returns 3.14
                    Circle.calculateArea(5);                   // returns 78.5
    - Static and non-static fields with the same name can exists without any error.
      The static field will be accessed using dot notation and the non-static field can be accessed using an object.
      For Example : class Circle {
                        static pi = 3.14;
                        pi = 3;
                    }
                    // Try to access Static Member
                    Circle.pi;                                // returns 3.14
                    // Try to Access non-static member through object of class
                    let circleObj = new Circle();
                    circleObj.pi;                             // returns 3
